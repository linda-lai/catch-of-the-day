## Background
Catch of the Day is a real-time application built with dynamic website components using React and Firebase, featured in the React for Beginners course by Wes Bos.

The application features a dynamically rendered menu, order form and inventory management section where authorised users can immediately update product details.

This course allowed me to reinforce my ES6 familiarity and deep dive into React concepts like React Router, managing state, persistence using Firebase and HTML5 LocalStorage and deployment to consolidate my learning as a student.
